# TODO App Take-Home Assignment

This simple todo app loads a list of todos from a remote server and allows for users to update its status to complete which will notify the server about the updated status.
Note: API Enpoint with API key currently returns 403 error, I mocked the test data using the provided example response json at this time to simulate the API response.

## Setup and running the project
* Clone the project
* run ```$ npm install```
* run ```$ npm run dev```
* Open a web browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:5173/``` (note the port number by default will typically be ```5173``` , however if it isn't please change port number to the port number designated by VITE in the terminal)
